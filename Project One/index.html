          <h2>Freedom Fighter Of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Bhagat Singh</b> was born on September 27, 1907, in the village
            of Banga near Lyallpur district in Punjab, British India. He was an
            Indian freedom fighter who is considered to be one of the most
            influential revolutionaries of the Indian independence movement.
            Bhagat Singh joined the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) at a
            young age and became involved in revolutionary activities. He
            participated in several acts of sabotage against British
            institutions, including an attempt to bomb the Central Legislative
            Assembly in Delhi. In 1929, he and two other activists were
            convicted of assassinating John Saunders, a British police officer.
            Singh was executed by hanging on March 23, 1931, at Lahore jail at
            the age of 23. Despite his short life, Bhagat Singh left a lasting
            legacy in the struggle for Indian independence. He is revered by
            many as a martyr and symbol of resistance to British colonialism in
            India. His example continues to inspire new generations of activists
            worldwide.
